  <h2>How puppet classes work?</h2>
  <p>Lets start with the basics, in the classes we can declare <span class="text-bold-green">packages</span> and <span class="text-bold-green">services</span>.</p>
    
  <p><span class="text-bold-green">Packages</span> can be declared to be installed, removed and ensured to be the latest version among many things</p>
  <p><span class="text-bold-green">Services</span> basically allow us to state which programs should be running.</p>
  <p>Consider this puppet class example:</p>
    
  <pre><code>
<span class="text-pink">class</span> <span class="text-blue">web</span> {

  <span class="text-green">package</span> { [<span class="text-purple">'httpd'</span>, <span class="text-purple">'mod_ssl'</span>]:
    ensure => installed,
  }

  <span class="text-green">service</span> {<span class="text-purple">'httpd'</span>:
    ensure  => running,
    enable  => true,
    require => <span class="text-green">Package</span>[<span class="text-purple">'httpd'</span>],
  }
}
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>Here we have a class called web. It declares that the packages <span class="text-purple">httpd</span> and <span class="text-purple">mod_ssl</span> should be installed.<br>
    They will be installed using the OS package system, in our case yum. Everytime puppet runs it will call yum to install the packages should they not be installed.</p>

  <p>Next we see the class want the service <span class="text-purple">httpd</span> to be running and be enabled which means start at boot.<br> 
    Services can be though to be connected to the OS service managment, in our case systemd.<br>
    This service require the package <span class="text-purple">httpd</span> to be installed before puppet executes this block. This means puppet will first install <span class="text-purple">httpd</span> before trying to start it using systemd.
</p>

  <p><span class="text-bold-green">Files</span> can be declared like this:</p>

  <pre><code>
  <span class="text-green">file</span> { <span class="text-purple">'/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf'</span>:
    owner    => root,
    group    => root,
    mode     => 644,
    notify   => <span class="text-green">Service</span>[<span class="text-purple">'httpd'</span>],
    content  => <span class="text-green">file</span>(<span class="text-purple">'web/ssl.conf'</span>),
  }

  </code></pre>

  <p>Here we have declared that the file <span class="text-purple">'/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf'</span> will have root as owner and group with permissions 644.<br>
    We see that should this file change, the next time puppet runs it will notify the service <span class="text-purple">httpd</span>. This means <span class="text-purple">httpd</span> will usually means restart the service.<br>
    <br>
    Lastly but most importantly we say that this file should be a copy of the file <span class="text-purple">'web/ssl.conf'</span> which means the file called <span class="text-purple">'ssl.conf</span> located in the <span class="text-blue">web</span> class.<br>
    Since this is a file it will exist in the directory called <span class="text-purple">'files'</span> in the <span class="text-blue">'web'</span> class directory. <br>
    <br>
    So everytime we edit the file in <span class="text-purple">'web/ssl.conf'</span> on the puppetmaster, the next time puppet run it will put that file at <span class="text-purple">'/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf'</span> on all puppet clients who have the <span class="text-blue">web</span> class assigned to them and then restart <span class="text-purple">httpd</span><br>
    <br>
    So the more puppet clients with the <span class="text-blue">web</span> class you have the more time you will save.</p>
